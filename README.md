Sample Application

I have chosen to use VIPER as the architecture since the requirements seem to fit well with it.

All code in this project was programmed using TDD, with tests written first.

Naming Conventions:
Protocols are all named with prefix 'Type', e.g. DataStoreType. Everyone has discussions around protocol naming conventions, and I have found that this works for me.

3rd party libraries:

I have used Kingfisher, for image loading. I have used this library many times before in a professional setting. I know the code is of high quality and has been audited by a company I have worked for before.


Further Improvements
I would improve the UI, and implement tapping the cells to load a more detailed view page to expose the rest of the data to the user. This would also allow me to reate a proper VIPER module loader and handle navigation and configuration of viewcontroller dependencies in a more standard way.

Sample Application

I have chosen to use VIPER as the architecture since the requirements seem to fit well with it.

All code in this project was programmed using TDD, with tests written first.

Naming Conventions:
Protocols are all named with prefix 'Type', e.g. DataStoreType. Everyone has discussions around protocol naming conventions, and I have found that this works for me.
